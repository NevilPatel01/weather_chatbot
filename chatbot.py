Weather ChatBot Application
Author: Nevil Patel and Jaskirat Kaur
Date: November 15th, 2024

Description:

The Weather ChatBot application is designed to provide users with an engaging and informative way to inquire about weather conditions. The chatbot uses OpenAI's GPT model for natural language processing, enabling it to understand and analyze user input in a conversational manner. It integrates with Visual Crossing's API to fetch real-time weather data, allowing it to respond to queries about current weather, temperature, humidity, and even forecasts for specific dates, whether mentioned directly or relatively (e.g., "tomorrow" or "next week"). The bot is capable of understanding casual, informal queries and generating friendly, contextual responses, making the user experience more interactive. It also remembers previous queries, such as the city or type of weather requested, ensuring smooth follow-up conversations. Additionally, the chatbot is equipped to handle non-weather-related queries, responding with humorous or engaging answers when necessary. Overall, this application combines advanced AI-driven language processing with real-time weather data, offering a personalized and fun user experience for all weather-related inquiries.

    To extract the structured information from the user's input using OpenAI's GPT model.

    Args:
     user_input (str): The user's input.

    Returns:

        If there is an error processing the OpenAI response.

    Analyze the user's input to determine if it is weather-related or a casual inquiry.
    Extract the "tone", "city", "requirement" (e.g., "temperature", "feels like", "humidity", "fact"),
    and optionally a "date" for weather inquiries. If it is a non-weather inquiry (like a general question or greeting),
    categorize it as "other" with a "message" field.
    The date should be returned in a format that is compatible with Visual Crossing API (e.g., yyyy-MM-dd).
    Also, handle common relative dates like "yesterday", "2 days ago", "tomorrow", and "today", and convert them into valid date formats (yyyy-MM-dd).

   Handle these cases:
    1. Specific date: Parse and return the weather details.
    2. Relative date: Convert to "yyyy-MM-dd" format.
    3. Vague input: Refer to {dialog_context} to determine the date, city for dialog management.
    4. Non-weather queries: Categorize under "other" with a "message" field.

    Examples:
    Input: "What is your favourite season?"
    Expected Output:
    {{
        "other": "general inquiry",
        "message": "What is your favourite season?"
    }}

    Input: "Can you tell me a fun fact about rain?"
    Expected Output:
    {{
        "tone": "casual",
        "requirement": "fact",
        "phenomenon": "rain"
    }}

    Input: "What's the temperature in Paris tomorrow?"
    Expected Output:
    {{
        "tone": "neutral",
        "city": "Paris",
        "requirement": "temperature",
        "date": "2024-11-16"
    }}
    NOTE: If "that day", "same day" or similar kind of words used try to get last_date from dialog_context.
    See I have wrote tomorrow's actual date and If only date is mentioned use current month and year for default date
    Input: "Which city today will have the highest cold temperature?"
